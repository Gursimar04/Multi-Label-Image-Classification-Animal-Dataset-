## Dataset

The training dataset consists of over 8000  animal images belonging to 5 categories: Mucca (Cow) and Pecora (Sheep),Scoiattolo (Squirrel), farfella (Butterfly) and Elefante (Elephant). All the images have been collected from "google images" and have been checked by humans. There are some erroneous data to simulate real conditions (eg. images taken by users of your app).
